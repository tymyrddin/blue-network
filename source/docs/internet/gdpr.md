## Step-by-Step GDPR compliance check

### Data mapping & inventory

* Identify all personal data you collect (names, emails, IPs, cookies).
* Document processing purposes (e.g., marketing, analytics).
* Track data flows (where it’s stored, who accesses it).

Tool: Use a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) template ([EU GDPR DPIA Guidelines](https://edpb.europa.eu/DPIA)).

### Legal basis & consent

Explicit Consent (for marketing, cookies):

* Must be opt-in (no pre-ticked boxes).
* Users must be able to withdraw consent easily.

Legitimate Interest (e.g., fraud prevention):

* Conduct a Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA).

Check:

* Are cookie banners GDPR-compliant?
* Is consent logged (timestamp, user ID)?

### User Rights (Articles 15-22)

Verify users can:

* Access their data (DSAR – Data Subject Access Request).
* Rectify incorrect data.
* Erase data ("Right to be Forgotten").
* Port data to another service.
* Object to processing (e.g., opt out of profiling).

Tool:

* Automated DSAR system (e.g., OneTrust, Osano).
* Privacy dashboard (e.g., "My Account" page).

### Security Measures

* Encryption (data at rest & in transit).
* Access Controls (role-based permissions).
* Pseudonymization (where possible).
* Regular security audits (ISO 27001, SOC 2).

Check:

* Do you have a breach response plan?
* Are employees trained on data protection policies?

### Third-Party Compliance

* Review vendors (cloud providers, SaaS) for GDPR compliance.
* Sign Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with processors.
* Ensure SCCs (Standard Contractual Clauses) for non-EU transfers.

Tool: Vendor risk assessment (e.g., TrustArc).

### Documentation & accountability

* Privacy Policy (clear, GDPR-compliant).
* Records of Processing Activities (ROPA).
* Data Protection Officer (DPO) if required.

Check:

* Is your privacy policy updated?
* Are audit logs maintained?
