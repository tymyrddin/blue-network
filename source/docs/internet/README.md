# Introduction

## What?

Internet security mitigations are defensive measures to protect networks, systems, and users from cyber threats targeting public-facing infrastructure. These include attacks like BGP hijacking, DDoS, phishing, zero-day exploits, and certificate spoofing.

## Why?

* Prevent Service Disruption: DDoS attacks can take websites offline, costing millions in downtime.
* Stop Data Theft: Weak encryption or misconfigured services expose sensitive data.
* Mitigate Global Threats: BGP hijacks, DNS spoofing, and ransomware spread across borders.
* Compliance & Trust: Regulations (e.g., GDPR, CISA) require proactive protections.
