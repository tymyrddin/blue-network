# Disable SSID broadcasting

The access point is, by default, configured to broadcast that SSID name out on the network. 
This means that clients can browse the network to find the SSID even after having changed the SSID. 
To lock down the SSID a bit more, configure the access point to not broadcast the
SSID. This means that clients will not see your wireless network when they browse
for wireless networks.

May this not lead to a false sense of security. [It is not really hidden](https://network.tymyrddin.dev/docs/notes/intrusions).
