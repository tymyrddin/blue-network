# Enable encryption

When configuring the access point for an encryption protocol, a key or passphrase is chosen, that is required by 
anyone who wants to connect to the network. Any clients who connect with that key are able to access the wireless 
network, and all the traffic from the wireless client to the access point is encrypted traffic.

* only those who know the passphrase, or encryption key, can connect. 
* those clients that have been configured with the same encryption key are sending and receiving encrypted traffic 
with the access point.

## Use the strongest encryption protocol available

Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) and Personal Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are currently the most secure router 
configurations available for home use. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is capable of using cryptographic keys of 
128, 192, and 256 bits.
