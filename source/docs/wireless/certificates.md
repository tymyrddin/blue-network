# Use certificate-based security

With certificate-based authentication, certificates are installed on the client systems who then present their 
certificate to the access point to gain access to the wireless network. 

Certificate-based authentication provides an extra layer of security over the wireless encryption protocols,
because the encryption protocols have a number of tools used to crack the encryption keys.
