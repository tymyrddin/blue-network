# Turn it off

Consider disabling it during travel or extended periods when you will not need to be online. Depending on 
manufacturer of the WLAN router, it may be impractical to turn the Wi-Fi signal off and on frequently. 
Some routers have a button for quickly turning off Wi-Fi and some even offer the option to configure a 
wireless schedule that will automatically disable the Wi-Fi at specified times.
